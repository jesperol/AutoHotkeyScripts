## AutoHotkeyScripts
Uses a slightly version modified version of https://github.com/Ciantic/VirtualDesktopAccessor adapted to work with Windows 11 to switch and move windows beteween Virtual Desktops. There exists a .dll in the Lib/ folder that works up to Windows10 21H2 also. 

To use another creative trick to move windows between desktops without having to resort to DLL-calls `VirtualDesktopTricks.ahk` can be #included in place of `VirtualDesktopAccessor.ahk` in the main script.
